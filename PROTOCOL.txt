Link messages are used for everything. Channel means the integer, and the string is the command itself.

300: A script will relay authorized chat commands into link messages on 300.

0: Link messages to 0 will get relayed to multiple destinations, including optional ground-based message boards.

-1: Initialization. Protocol is as follows:
    Initializer script sends -1,INIT
    Subsystem scripts initialize, then send -1,INITED: $SCRIPT_NAME (all Telemetry scripts + others have names starting with subsystem_)
    When all subsystem scripts are inited, Initializer sends -1,READY
    When launching, Initializer sends -1,LAUNCH
